# Orientation
## About ?
As my [first website](https://github.com/Ahegan/First-Website), this website was made for my high school. This website is only in french (sorry, this project isn't important enough for me to translate it) and i used **HTML**, **CSS** and a bit of **JS** homemade unlike the JavaScirpt I used on my first website
## Single Page
Certainly one of my worst ideas : make a one page web-site by using JSON for the content of each page. This results in many inconsistencies and optimization problems but well, you have to try realise how bad it is.

Update : 3 days have past since I've startes the JS of the webstite ans the more time goes by, the worst it get. Positiv side ? I am discovering more and more things not to do in javascript, good to know for future projects
