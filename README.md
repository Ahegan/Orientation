# Orientation
## About ?
As my [first website](https://github.com/Ahegan/First-Website), this website was made for my high school. This website is only in french (sorry, this project isn't important enough for me to translate it) and i used **HTML**, **CSS** and a bit of **JS** homemade unlike the JavaScirpt I used on my first website
